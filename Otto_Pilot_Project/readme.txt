
I've only had luck by building the package oustide of the simulator with the included package building tool.

Delete the _PackageInt, Packages, and PackageMetadata folders.
Then drag and drop your project.xml file into the fspackagetool.exe after you have modified the project. 
Place the created package into your community folder and start the sim for testing. (There may be a better way to go about doing this but I haven't found it)
